        The story begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia family, overseeshis daughter's wedding.
        His
        beloved son ichael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's
        business. T hrough Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the
        family
        is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless

        Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels
        the
        young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of
        the
        dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America
        after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife
        and
        growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of
        the
        tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.
